V Language Code Snippets

This repository contains code snippets from various chapters of the V Language Intermediate Guide. These examples showcase different V programming concepts, including file handling, web scraping, concurrency, and working with external data.

Code Snippets Overview

factorial_function.v

A simple implementation of the factorial function using a loop.

file_processor.v

Demonstrates reading from and writing to files in V, including handling file operations with proper error handling.

web_scraper.v

An example of how to perform asynchronous web scraping using V’s concurrency model (with go and async).

database_example.v

Shows how to work with a SQLite database using V, including creating a table and inserting and querying data.

weather_app.v

Fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap using HTTP requests and parses the JSON response.

Usage

To use any of these code snippets, follow these steps:

Install V Programming Language
Make sure that you have V installed on your machine. If not, you can install it by following the instructions on the official V website
.

Running the Code Snippets

Save the snippet in a .v file, such as factorial_function.v.

Run the file using the following command:

v run <filename>.v


For example:

v run factorial_function.v

Notes

Ensure that any necessary external dependencies (such as an API key for the weather_app.v) are correctly set up before running the code.

Each file contains a specific functionality to help you better understand the V language’s capabilities in various real-world scenarios.
